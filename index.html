      The question 13 has 2 subquestions :
    <ol>
      <p>
        a)
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public%E2%80%93private_partnership"> Public Private
          Partnership
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
      <p>b) Can PPP overcome the deficient supply of pure public and merit goods?</p>
      Ans :
      <b>Merit Goods</b> include goods which are provided by both government and private sectors. They are goods which
      depend on product consumption directly. People using those need to pay for it, and they get exhausted too often
      due to high consumption. They are available for personal consumption and to only a certain section of the society.
      For example, the construction of buildings of hospitals and schools, and their maintainance.
      <br>
      <b>Pure public goods</b> on the other hand are meant to be provided to one all regardless of who pays for it. They
      are made available by the government to the common public and are meant for mass consumption. Examples may be
      defence system, waste Management system, legal system, and street lighting.
      <br>
      <b>PPP or 3P</b> is responsible in incrementing the usage and availability of the pure public goods and merit
      goods. The taxpayers pay for their construction, and the private actors, businessmen, corporate industrialists
      invest in them, as a result the goods get available for all in no time, and the monetary expense for its
      availability gets dealt with smoothly. Also since expenses gets managed by the big firm, the scope of innovation
      and efficiency improves. The provision of incentives improves competition.

      The question 15 has 2 subsections :
    <ol>
      <p>
        a) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/cost-accounting/budget/32753">Budget</a>
      </p>
      <p> b) Objectives of budget are :
      <ul>
        1. To get more economic use of capital. <br>

        2. To prevent waste and reduce expenses. <br>

        3. To facilitate various departments to operate efficiently and economically. <br>

        4. To coordinate the activities of various departments. <br>

        5. To plan and control the income & expenditure of the firm. <br>

        6. To fix the responsibilities in different departments. <br>

        7. To ensure the availability of working capital. <br>

        8. To ensure the matching of sales with production. <br>
      </ul>
      <p>
        c) Advantages of a Budget Manual: <br>
      <ol>

        1. It acts as a guide book of all departments involved in the budgeting process. <br>

        2. Less confusion will occur if answers to questions can be obtained from the manual. <br>

        3. It will be easier to resolve any difference between two departments when there are written instructions in
        the budget manual. <br>

        4. Reliance on memory is eliminated when a procedure is given in writing. <br>

        5. Clear instructions in budget manual will save time of the superiors as juniors will not ask for approval time
        and again. <br>

        6. It will reduce training time of the employees as oral instructions are supplemented with written procedures.
        <br>
      </ol>
      <p>
        d) Limitations of Budgeting : <br>
        While budgeting performs many functions and has many advantages that are vital to an organization; it has
        certain limitations which require careful consideration. <br>

        <ol>
        (a) Planning, budgeting, or forecasting is not an exact science; it uses approximations and judgement which may
        not be cent per cent accu­rate. At best, a budget is an estimate; no one knows precisely what will happen in the
        future. <br>

        (b) The success and utility of budgeting depends on the cooperation and participation of all members of
        management. All persons should direct their efforts according to the plan. Moreover, the top management should
        adhere to the budget and provide cooperation. <br>

        (c) A budget is only a tool, and it neither eliminates nor takes over the place of management. A budget cannot
        be substituted for manage­ment but should only be used by the management for accomplishing managerial functions.
        Executives generally feel ‘circled in’ by a budget and its related figures. 

        They fail to understand that the budget is meant to provide detailed information, goals, and targets which may
        help them in achieving the company objectives. <br>

        (d) It takes time to establish an efficient budgeting process. Also, some­times too much is expected from a
        budget and in case expectations are not fulfilled, the blame is put on the budget. An efficient budgeting
        programme requires that the responsible persons should understand the philosophy, objectives, and essentials of
        budgeting. <br>

        (e) Excessive emphasis on budgeting may result in attempts by lower level of management and employees to buck
        the system by provid­ing inaccurate estimates of future costs and revenues. <br>
